    "# Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter notebook, formerly known as the IPython notebook, is a flexible tool that helps you create readable analyses, as you can keep code, images, comments, formulae and plots together. In this post, we’ve collected some of the top Jupyter notebook tips to quickly turn you into a Jupyter power user!\n",
    "\n",
    "(This post is based on a post that originally appeared on Alex Rogozhnikov’s blog, ‘Brilliantly Wrong’. We have expanded the post and will continue to do so over time — if you have a suggestion please let us know. Thanks to Alex for graciously letting us republish his work here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is quite extensible, supports many programming languages and is easily hosted on your computer or on almost any server — you only need to have ssh or http access. Best of all, it’s completely free. Now let’s dive in to our list of 28 (and counting!) Jupyter notebook tips!\n",
    "\n",
    "interface-screenshot\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Jupyter interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython project as the project evolved to become a notebook that could support multiple languages – hence its historical name as the IPython notebook. The name Jupyter is an indirect acronyum of the three core languages it was designed for: JUlia, PYThon, and R and is inspired by the planet Jupiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with Python in Jupyter, the IPython kernel is used, which gives us some handy access to IPython features from within our Jupyter notebooks (more on that later!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to show you 28 tips and tricks to make your life working with Jupyter easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "As any power user knows, keyboard shortcuts will save you lots of time. Jupyter stores a list of keybord shortcuts under the menu at the top: Help > Keyboard Shortcuts, or by pressing H in command mode (more on that later). It’s worth checking this each time you update Jupyter, as more shortcuts are added all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to access keyboard shortcuts, and a handy way to learn them is to use the command palette: Cmd + Shift + P (or Ctrl + Shift + P on Linux and Windows). This dialog box helps you run any command by name – useful if you don’t know the keyboard shortcut for an action or if what you want to do does not have a keyboard shortcut. The functionality is similar to Spotlight search on a Mac, and once you start using it you’ll wonder how you lived without it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The command palette\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of my favorites:\n",
    "\n",
    "Esc will take you into command mode where you can navigate around your notebook with arrow keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in command mode:\n",
    "A - to insert a new cell above the current cell, B to insert a new cell below.\n",
    "M - to change the current cell to Markdown\n",
    "Y - to change it back to code\n",
    "D + D (press the key twice) to delete the current cell\n",
    "Enter will take you from command mode back into edit mode for the given cell.\n",
    "Shift + Tab will show you the Docstring (documentation) for the the object you have just typed in a code cell – you can keep pressing this short cut to cycle through a few modes of documentation.\n",
    "Ctrl + Shift + - will split the current cell into two from where your cursor is.\n",
    "Esc + F Find and replace on your code but not the outputs.\n",
    "Esc + O Toggle cell output.\n",
    "Select Multiple Cells:\n",
    "Shift + J or Shift + Down selects the next sell in a downwards direction. You can also select sells in an upwards direction by using Shift + K or Shift + Up.\n",
    "Once cells are selected, you can then delete / copy / cut / paste / run them as a batch. This is helpful when you need to move parts of a notebook.\n",
    "You can also use Shift + M to merge multiple cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "multi-merge\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging multiple cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Pretty Display of Variables\n",
    "The first part of this is pretty widely known. By finishing a Jupyter cell with the name of a variable or unassigned output of a statement, Jupyter will display that variable without the need for a print statement. This is especially useful when dealing with Pandas DataFrames, as the output is neatly formatted into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is known less, is that you can alter a modify the ast_note_interactivity kernel option to make jupyter do this for any variable or statement on it’s own line, so you can see the value of multiple statements at once.\n",

    "mpld3 provides alternative renderer (using d3) for matplotlib code. Quite nice, though incomplete.\n",
    "bokeh is a better option for building interactive plots.\n",
    "plot.ly can generate nice plots – this used to be a paid service only but was recently open sourced.\n",
    "Altair is a relatively new declarative visualization library for Python. It’s easy to use and makes great looking plots, however the ability to customize those plots is not nearly as powerful as in Matplotlib.\n",

    "6. IPython Magic – %env: Set Environment Variables\n",
    "You can manage environment variables of your notebook without restarting the jupyter server process. Some libraries (like theano) use environment variables to control behavior, %env is the most convenient way.\n",
