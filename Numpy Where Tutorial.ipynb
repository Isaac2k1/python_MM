    "Looking up for entries that satisfy a specific condition is a painful process, especially if you are searching it in a large dataset having hundreds or thousands of entries. If you know the fundamental SQL queries, you must be aware of the ‘WHERE’ clause that is used with the SELECT statement to fetch such entries from a relational database that satisfy certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy offers similar functionality to find such items in a NumPy array that satisfy a given Boolean condition through its ‘where()‘ function — except that it is used in a slightly different way than the SQL SELECT statement with the WHERE clause.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we’ll look at the various ways the NumPy where function can be used for a variety of use cases. Let’s get going.\n",

    "We’ll first create a 1-dimensional array of 10 integer values randomly chosen between 0 and 9.\n"
