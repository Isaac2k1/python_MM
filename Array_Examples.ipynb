    "An array is a data structure that stores values of same data type. In Python, this is the main difference between arrays and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "While python lists can contain values corresponding to different data types, arrays in python can only contain values corresponding to same data type. In this tutorial, we will understand the Python arrays with few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to Python, get started with the Python Introduction article.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use arrays in python language, you need to import the standard ‘array’ module. This is because array is not a fundamental data type like strings, integer etc. Here is how you can import ‘array’ module in python :\n"

    "## 1. Basic example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example of an array containing 5 integers\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "~$ python\n",
    "Python 2.7.4 (default, Apr 19 2013, 18:28:01)\n",
    "[GCC 4.7.3] on linux2\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> from array import *\n",
    ">>> my_array = array('i', [1,2,3,4,5])\n",
    ">>> for i in my_array:\n",
    "... print(i)\n",
    "...\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So this way we can create a simple python array and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Access individual elements through indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual elements can be accessed through indexes. Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array[1]\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> my_array[2]\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> my_array[0]\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that indexes start from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Append any value to the array using append() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.append(6)\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the value ‘6’ was appended to the existing array values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Insert value in an array using insert() method\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the insert() method to insert a value at any index of the array. Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.insert(0,0)\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, using insert() method, the value 0 was inserted at index 0. Note that the first argument is the index while second argument is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Extend python array using extend() method\n",
    "\n",
    "A python array can be extended with more than one value using extend() method. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_extnd_array = array('i', [7,8,9,10])\n",
    ">>> my_array.extend(my_extnd_array)\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the array my_array was extended with values from my_extnd_array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Add items from list into array using fromlist() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> c=[11,12,13]\n",
    ">>> my_array.fromlist(c)\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the values 11,12 and 13 were added from list ‘c’ to ‘my_array’.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Remove any array element using remove() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.remove(13)\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the element 13 was removed from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Remove last array element using pop() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.pop()\n",
    "12\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the last element 12 was popped out of array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Fetch any element through its index using index() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.index(5)\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the value at index 5 was fetched through this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Reverse a python array using reverse() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.reverse()\n",
    ">>> my_array\n",
    "array('i', [11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the complete array got reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Get array buffer information through buffer_info() method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method provides you the array buffer start address in memory and number of elements in array. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.buffer_info()\n",
    "(33881712, 12)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that buffer start address and number of elements were provided in output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Check for number of occurrences of an element using count() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_array.count(11)\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the element 11 occurred only once in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Convert array to string using tostring() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_char_array = array('c', ['g','e','e','k'])\n",
    ">>> my_char_array\n",
    "array('c', 'geek')\n",
    ">>> my_char_array.tostring()\n",
    "'geek'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the character array was converted to string using this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Convert array to a python list with same elements using tolist() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> c = my_array.tolist()\n",
    ">>> c\n",
    "[11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that list ‘c’ was created by using tolist() method on my_array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Append a string to char array using fromstring() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_char_array.fromstring(\"stuff\")\n",
    ">>> my_char_array\n",
    "array('c', 'geekstuff')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that the string “stuff” was added to my_char_array."
