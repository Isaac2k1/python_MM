    "# Python: How to Write a Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Posted by: Jeremy Grifski in Python January 30th, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "As this series grows, I often find myself revisiting the fundamentals. For instance, today we’ll be learning how to write a loop in Python. Luckily for you, there’s some bonus material on recursion as well.\n",
    "In short, there are two core ways of writing a loop, while and for. If you’re looking for a tradition loop, opt for the while loop. Meanwhile, if you have some sequence or iterable to traverse, opt for the for loop. If you find a scenario which gets messy with a loop (e.g. tree traversal), don’t be afraid to fall back on recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "When you first get into programming, you often go through a progression of different pieces of syntax. For instance, you might learn about printing and variables. Then, you might expand your knowledge into arithmetic and boolean expressions. If all goes well, you might even learn about conditionals.\n",
    "As time goes on, you might ask yourself “but, what if I want to do something repeatedly?” Luckily, most imperative programming languages have a syntax for this called looping. Essentially, we repeat a task until we satisfy some condition.\n",
    "Of course, if you’ve come from another programming language, you already know all about looping (or at least recursion). The trouble is getting used to the new syntax. Fortunately, we have several different solutions which we’ll take a look at in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions\n",
    "In this section, we’ll take a look at three different ways to write a loop in Python. First, we’ll look at recursion, a functional technique. Then, we’ll dive into the two iterative techniques, while and for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursion\n",
    "Before we dig into the various loop syntax in Python, I feel like it’s important to mention recursion as a concept. After all, we don’t actually need loops at all. We can get away from writing functions which reference themselves:"

    "In this example, we’ve written a function called recurse() which calls itself. If we run it, however, we’ll get an error:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Of course, this makes sense. After all, if a function calls itself, then it will call itself, then it will call itself, then it will call itself… alright, my head is spinning.\n",

Since it is, we drop into the loop where we print “Input is 5” and decrement i. Then, the process repeats. Of course, now i is 4 instead of 5. Overall time, i will decrement until it is -1, and the loop condition will fail.\n",
    "In Python, while can be used to implement any indefinite loop. In other words, use a while loop when you don’t know how many iterations you’ll have ahead of time. For example, while loops are perfect for reading from files or prompting for input from a user. In the next section, we’ll take a look at an example of a definite loop.\n",

For example, in Java, there are at least four different loop syntaxes that I’m aware of (e.g. while, for, for each, do while). Since Python tries to keep things simple, the number of loop syntaxes are limited. As far as I know, there are only two: for and while.\n",
    "Now, for loops in Python aren’t like for loops in other languages. Instead of providing a space to track an index, they operate more like for each loops in other languages. In other words, we need something to iterate over like a list. Let’s try recreating our while loop from above:\n"
