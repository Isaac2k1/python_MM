    "Imagine you work at a small internet startup that keeps track of its users' web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). You store the data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the data, you load the gathered browser data into a large list of strings, but because of a bug in your tracking algorithm, every second string is corrupted and needs to be replaced by the correct string.\n",

    "\n",
    "You conclude that the first browser value will be equal to the second one in most cases because the browser of a user stays the same while waiting for the redirection to occur. This means that you can easily reproduce the original data.\n",

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first idea is to create a new list, iterate over the corrupted list, and add every non-corrupted browser twice to the new list. But you reject the idea because you’d then have to maintain two lists in your code—and each may have millions of entries. Also, this solution would require a few lines of code, which would reduce conciseness and readability of your source code.\n",

    "By plotting expected cardiac cycle data, you’ll enable patients and doctors to monitor any deviation from that cycle. For example, given a series of measurements stored in the list [62, 60, 62, 64, 68, 77, 80, 76, 71, 66, 61, 60, 62] for a single cardiac cycle, you want to achieve the visualization:\n",

    "In addition, you’ll use the matplotlib.pyplot module to plot the cardiac data you generate.

    "You work in law enforcement for the US Department of Labor, finding companies that pay below minimum wage so you can initiate further investigations. Like hungry dogs on the back of a meat truck, your Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) officers are already waiting for the list of companies that violated the minimum wage law. Can you give it to them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s your weapon: Python’s any() function, which takes an iterable, such as a list, and returns True if at least one element of the iterable evaluates to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the expression any([True, False, False, False]) evaluates to True, while the expression any([2<1, 3+2>5+5, 3-2<0, 0]) evaluates to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, was a huge fan of the built-in function any() and even proposed to include it as a built-in function in Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting Python extension is a generalization of list comprehension: generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator expressions work exactly like list comprehensions—but without creating an actual list in memory. The numbers are created on the fly, without storing them explicitly in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of using list comprehension to calculate the squares of the first 20 numbers, sum([x*x for x in range(20)]), you can use a generator expression: sum(x*x for x in range(20)).\n",

    "If at least one of them is below minimum wage, the function any() would return True, and the company name x would be stored as a string in the resulting list i, as described next.\n",

    "(2) The second generator expression is the list comprehension [x for x in c if any(...)] and it creates a list of company names for which the previous call of the function any() returns True. Those are the companies that pay below minimum wage. \n",
