    "Problem Description\n",

    "\n",
    "You may ask - why? - and rightly so! \n",

    "\n",
    "In the following code example, you’re looking for the string 'SQL' in an Amazon letter to shareholders—with the immediate environment of up to 18 positions around the string 'SQL'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the one-liner solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "letters_amazon = '''\n",
    "We spent several years building our own database engine,\n",
    "Amazon Aurora, a fully-managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible\n",
    "service with the same or better durability and availability as\n",
    "the commercial engines, but at one-tenth of the cost. We were\n",
    "not surprised when this worked.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "## One-Liner\n",
    "find = lambda txt, q: txt[txt.find(q)-18:txt.find(q)+18]\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "print(find(letters_amazon, 'SQL'))\n",
    "## a fully-managed MySQL and PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You define a lambda function with two arguments: string value x, and query q to search for in the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "You assign the lambda function to the name find. The function find(x, q) finds the string query q in the string text x.\n",
    "\n",
    "If query q does not appear in string x, you directly return the result -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, you use slicing on the text string to carve out the first occurrence of the query, plus 18 characters to the left of the query and 18 characters to the right, to capture the query’s environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index of the first occurrence of q in x uses the string function x.find(q). You call the function twice: to help determine the start index and the stop index of the slice, but both function calls return the same value because query q and string x do not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this code works perfectly fine, the redundant function call causes unnecessary computations—a disadvantage that could easily be fixed by adding a helper variable to temporarily store the result of the first function call. You could then reuse the result from the first function call by accessing the value in the helper variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights an important trade-off: by restricting yourself to one line of code, you cannot define and reuse a helper variable to store the index of the first occurrence of the query. Instead, you must execute the same function find to compute the start index (and decrement the result by 18 index positions) and to compute the end index (and increment the result by 18 index positions).\n",
