    "# How to Loop Over a Dictionary in Python: Keys, Values, and More\n",
    "Posted by: Jeremy Grifski in Python 2020-06-19\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to yet another How to Python article. Today, we’ll be looking at looping over dictionaries which appears to be a hot topic—at least by an organic standpoint.\n",
    "As it turns out, there are few ways to get it done. First, we could loop over the keys directly: for key in dictionary. Alternatively, we might only need to loop over the values: for value in dictionary.values(). That said, most folks probably need to be able to do both at the same time: for key, value in dictionary.items().\n",
    "If you’re interested in learning more about these solutions, the remainder of this article will take some time to help you out. At the very least, I’d love it if you completed the challenge below.\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "In the past, we talked about writing loops generally. Of course, when it comes to working with common data structures like lists and tuples in Python, looping over them is a breeze:"

    "If we want to loop over this, what order can we expect it to be in? And, does the concept of ordering even make sense? Likewise, what do the elements look like during iteration?\n",
    "Before we dive in, I think it’s important to address a couple of these questions right out of the gate. First, dictionaries have a temporal ordering—at least since Python 3.7—which means that items are sorted by the order in which they were added.\n",
    "That said, element question is a bit more complicated, so we’ll take the rest of this article to answer it.\n",

    "# Solutions\n",
    "At this point, let’s go ahead and start talking about how to actually iterate over a dictionary. As it turns out, there are three main ways to do it, and it all depends on our needs. That said, we’ll start by looking at keys and values separately and finish up with a way to loop over both at the same time.\n",

    "Assuming we’re using the latest version of Python, we can iterate over both keys and values at the same time using the items() method. Essentially, this method packages each key and value as a tuple which can be unpacked using the iterable unpacking syntax (aka destructuring for you JavaScript folks).\n",
